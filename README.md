# What is Codeforces?
Codeforces' aim is to offer you a convenient platform to organize, run and discuss programming contests. It will be a bit of a social network website, more than a news portal and more than an online judge. Being absolutely independent from me, you will be able to organize and run a contest. You will decide on your own if to make it open to the whole world or if it will be a contest for your University only. And if you're not interested in this, you might discuss the news in the contest world - read/write blogs, discuss topics, and support your dearest and nearest.

# What is problem solving
Solving problems is the core of computer science. Programmers must first understand how a human solves a problem, then understand how to translate this "algorithm" into something a computer can do, and finally how to "write" the specific syntax (required by a computer) to get the job done. It is sometimes the case that a machine will solve a problem in a completely different way than a human.

# What you will find here?
The codes that I have written to solve the problems that are published on codeforce website.
